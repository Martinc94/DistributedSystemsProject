This project is An Asynchronous RMI String Comparison Service for my fourth year Distributed Systems project.
It compares two strings to find their distance using string comparison algorithms.	

#StringService.jar
This jar file contains the RMI service for comparing strings.
Also contains server and client for testing RMI service

#Comparator.war
This war file is for deployment on a tomcat server.
It contains all the files for handling the queuing of requests to the RMI Service.
QueueManager Handles requests to the RMI Service.

#src
Contains all of my source code

#Run the program
In the project directory run:

java â€“cp ./string-service.jar ie.gmit.sw.Servant

This should start up the RMI service on port 1099

Tomcat:

Startup your tomcat server by running Startup.bat in tomcats bin folder.

Place the comparator.war file into the webapps folder of the Tomcat server.
